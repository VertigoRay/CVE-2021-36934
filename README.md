# Remediation

In production, we found the need to remediate purge copies other than `ClientAccessible` ones; we had `Backup` types created by our backup tool.
Unfortunately, `vssadmin` cleary states that "only shadow copies that have the `ClientAccessible` type can be deleted."
In order to due that, we needed to shrink the size of the storage down to the smallest amount allowed (320MB).
We then bring it back to a normal/unbounded size.
